# Car-price-prediction
Predicting the price of a car based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, etc.
This project uses machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model and analyze the key factors influencing car prices.
To develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of a used car based on its characteristics such as:
Brand
Model
Year of Manufacture
Mileage
Fuel Type
Transmission Type
Number of Previous Owners, etc.

#Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Outlier detection and removal
Feature scaling
